# Space Invanders Game

This is a simple project in vanilla JavaScript where I’ve been learning a lot from Ania. Throughout this project, I’ve learned about Array.from(), setInterval(), clearInterval(), remove(), add(), contains(), setTimeout(), indexOf(), push(), and addEventListener().

Thank you, Ania! Your amazing videos have been a huge help!
